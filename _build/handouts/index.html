<h1>Increasing Confidence and the Purpose of QA</h1>
<p>First off, let’s take a look at a website, Yoodlize: <a class="reference external" href="https://alpha.yoodlize.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://alpha.yoodlize.com/</a></p>
<p>Take 30 minutes and get to know this website. You won’t have any sort of documentation, but one of the ways you can increase confidence is to know the item that you are testing.</p>
<p><strong>And be sure to document anything that seems wrong to you!</strong></p>
<p>Here are some pieces you can focus on to get a better understanding of Yoodlize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The search and advanced search sections</p></li>
<li><p>Logging in</p></li>
<li><p>The “How it works” section</p></li>
<li><p>The map in the search</p></li>
<li><p>etc…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you’re familiar with Yoodlize, let’s start to brainstorm what would be the most important thing to test. Of the pieces that you’ve looked at on Yoodlize, make a list of the order you would test them in.</p>
<p>Again, part of the purpose of QA is to keep track! So take a few minutes to organize your list of items you’d test, and the order you would test them into a document where you can access it easily.</p>
<p>Spend the next 10 minutes writing out your answer to these questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After spending some time exploring Yoodlize, what are your first impressions?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the site easy to use?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the user experience/flow of the website easy to navigate?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at a quick test! Maybe we can find an issue with the site. Go through each of the steps in this test. And at the end of the test if something is different from what the test says, write that down as an issue with the site!</p>
<p><strong>Yoodlize Search Test</strong></p>
<p>This test will search for a Rubik’s Cube on the site Yoodlize
Step 1: Navigate to Yoodlize’s Home Page
Step 2: Use the search bar to search for “Rubik’s Cube”</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>You should land on a list of items related to your search.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Step 3: Click on the first result</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there are no results be sure to document that issue</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Test Postconditions: You should now be on an item screen for a Rubik’s Cube.</p>
<p>If something happened during the test that wasn’t supposed to, again be sure to document that along with the rest of your notes.</p>
<p>Take some time searching for other items with Yoodlize, see if you can get different results from your searches!</p>
<p>Let’s use our work we’ve done so far to work on increasing confidence! Let’s come up with some metrics to show others the work that we’ve put in.
Take 10 minutes and create a list of known issues, and a list of positive pieces of Yoodlize!</p>
<p>Take another 20 minutes and think about how each of the notes you’ve taken for Yoodlize will relate to another. For instance, if you found a certain bug or issue due to a certain test you did, add a comment to each of those items relating them to each other.</p>
<p>One great way we can increase other’s confidence is to stay organized so you can always find the information you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s work more on increasing confidence! Take 30-40 minutes writing up a report of the issues you’ve found so far, and your honest thoughts with Yoodlize! Remember that we are increasing other’s confidence in us as a QA if we tell the truth about how we feel about the website!</p>
